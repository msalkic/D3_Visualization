<p> <Arial> Edgar Anderson's Iris data set consists of 150 samples of which 50 belong to each of the respective categories: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica. <br>
The left-bottom scatterplot was entirely designed by me after completing a tutorial on lynda.com.
The code for parallel coordinates was taken from <a href= "https://bl.ocks.org/jasondavies/1341281" >here </a <br>and
    <a href="http://mbostock.github.io/d3/talk/20111116/iris-parallel.html" >here; </a <br> however, parts were rewritten. Finally, the code for the side-by-side boxplots
        was borrowed from <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/rjurney/e04ceddae2e8f85cf3afe4681dac1d74" >here</a <br>. An important point here is that whiskers show the minimum and maximum
            values. Again, a good part of the code was rewritten
            (e.g. changing the scale location, changing the colors of the boxes, changing the scale so that it starts from 0, etc.). The parallel coordinates plot is
            interactive (i.e. one could substitute the location of y axis by dragging).
